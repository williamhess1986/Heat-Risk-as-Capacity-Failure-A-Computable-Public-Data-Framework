Heat Risk as Capacity Failure
The Capacity-Failure Model of Heat Risk
The Core Problem

Heat disasters occur when people, infrastructure, and socio-economic systems can no longer shed accumulated thermal or hydration load. Risk is driven by cumulative load plus recovery failure — not peak temperature alone. Systems fail faster when already strained by poverty, poor housing, chronic illness, aging populations, or lack of legal and economic protections.

Heat risk operates across multiple time scales:

Acute (hours–days): heatstroke, dehydration, power outages, emergency spikes

Sub-acute (days–weeks): mortality lag, hospital overload, cascading infrastructure strain

Chronic (months–years): organ damage, economic erosion, workforce decline, migration pressure

These timescales reinforce that heat disasters are not single events but progressive capacity failures.

Beyond the 35 °C Wet-Bulb Threshold

The 35 °C wet-bulb limit represents a theoretical survivability ceiling under idealized conditions. Real-world danger is better captured by Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), which incorporates solar radiation, air movement, humidity, and metabolic activity.

Certain medications (diuretics, beta-blockers, anticholinergics, some antidepressants), chronic illness, aging, infancy, and lack of acclimatization can shift the failure threshold far below theoretical limits.

Heat also impairs cognitive and behavioral capacity, reducing judgment, risk perception, productivity, and self-protective behavior while increasing accidents, workplace injuries, and conflict risk — meaning decision-making systems themselves degrade under thermal load.

The Recovery Window and Urban Inequality

Even small average temperature increases (~1–2 °C) disproportionately raise nighttime minimums, cutting the body's recovery window.

Urban heat islands — driven by asphalt, concrete, reduced vegetation, and waste heat from cooling systems — compound this. Historical redlining strongly predicts higher neighborhood temperatures, meaning disadvantaged communities reach capacity failure earlier and remain there longer.

Cooling adaptation can worsen inequality through:

Waste heat emissions

Grid overload and blackouts

Rising electricity costs

Local microclimate warming

Indoor Exposure and Built Environment

Most heat-related deaths occur indoors. Building insulation, ventilation, cooling access, housing density, and power reliability are key determinants — making heat risk as much an infrastructure problem as a climate one.

Economic Compulsion

Heat risk is often structurally forced. Piece-rate pay, absent work-stoppage protections, energy shut-offs, and limited public cooling spaces mean many people cannot reduce exposure even when it becomes dangerous. Biological limits then become policy outcomes.

Health System Capacity Limits

Medical systems are a critical amplification pathway in heat disasters. Capacity failure occurs when:

Emergency services become saturated

Hospitals lose cooling or power reliability

Staffing shortages worsen during heat waves

Supply chains for IV fluids, medications, and equipment are stressed

When health systems degrade, mortality rises sharply even without further temperature increases.

Nonlinear Risk, Cumulative Damage, and the Stages of Failure

Heat risk escalates across three linked stages:

Stable:
Recovery intact; infrastructure functioning normally; mortality near baseline.

Straining:
Nighttime recovery impaired; dehydration, illness, and grid instability increase; morbidity rises.

Failure:
Recovery absent; biological and infrastructural systems overwhelmed; mortality accelerates.

Peak mortality often lags peak temperature due to cumulative stress. Repeated exposure causes lasting damage — chronic kidney injury, cardiovascular strain, permanently reduced heat tolerance — even after apparent recovery.

Dry vs. Humid Heat

Humid heat limits evaporative cooling, causing rapid thermal overload. Dry heat drives dehydration and gradual cumulative strain. Both pathways lead to capacity failure.

Water–Energy Nexus

Extreme heat simultaneously spikes electricity and water demand while reducing power plant efficiency and grid reliability — creating the risk of synchronous infrastructure collapse where cooling and water supply fail together.

Compound Hazards and Ecological Feedbacks

Heat disasters often intensify when combined with other hazards that remove coping capacity, including wildfire smoke, drought, air pollution, or storm-related power outages.

Heat also stresses ecological systems, triggering feedback loops:

Crop failure and food insecurity

Livestock mortality

Urban tree canopy loss reducing future cooling

Water system degradation

These dynamics make heat disasters coupled human–environment capacity failures.

The Unified Principle

Heat disasters emerge from three converging forces:

Cumulative thermal and hydration load

Reduced biological, infrastructural, and cognitive recovery capacity

Constraints on exposure reduction

Adaptation in one group (heavy cooling use) can intensify exposure for others through local heat emissions, energy demand, and inequality.

Heat ceases to be a weather hazard and becomes a systemic mass-casualty risk when recovery windows disappear and exposure cannot be reduced.
